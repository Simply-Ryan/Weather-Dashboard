Weather Dashboard

Features:
1. Real-Time Weather Data:
   - Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather.
   - Display temperature, wind speed, humidity, rain chance, etc.

2. Weather Forecast:
   - Show weather forecasts for up to 5-7 days.
   - Include icons for different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

3. Search by City:
   - Allow users to input city names and fetch their weather data.
   - Implement search suggestions or autocomplete for ease of use.

4. Favorite Cities (Account Creation):
   - Enable users to create accounts.
   - Allow them to favorite certain cities and quickly access weather data.
   - Store favorite cities in the database and tie them to the user account.

5. Weather Details:
   - Show additional details like:
     - Date
     - Min/Max Temperatures
     - Humidity levels
     - Rain or snow probability

6. Dark Theme / Dynamic Theme:
   - Add a dark mode toggle for user preference.
   - Automatically change theme based on weather conditions:
     - Rainy = dark/blue theme
     - Sunny = bright/yellow theme
     - Cloudy = neutral grey theme

Additional Considerations:
- User Authentication:
  - Implement a login/signup system using Flask and an SQLite or SQLAlchemy database.

- Data Caching:
  - Cache weather data in SQLite to avoid frequent API requests for the same city within a short time period.

- Responsive Design:
  - Make sure the dashboard is mobile-friendly and adapts well to different screen sizes.

- Error Handling:
  - Handle cases where a city is not found, and show user-friendly error messages.

Technologies & Tools:
- Flask: Backend framework
- Jinja: Templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering
- SQLite: Database for storing user accounts and favorite cities
- HTML/CSS: For the frontend design
- JavaScript (optional): For adding interactivity like theme toggling
- OpenWeatherMap API: Source for weather data
